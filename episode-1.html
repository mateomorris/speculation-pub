				<h1><strong>Ep. 1 - CONTEXT: It starts with Ken</strong></h1><p><em>“I still call Ken my mentor, even though until recently we haven’t spoken for much of the last decade.&nbsp;“</em></p><p>From Nick:</p><p>It may be slightly odd to start off an online speakeasy with the co-creators chatting about themselves (and that is not lost on us). During this conversation though, I ask Ken about his early years and what got him into ministry. </p><p>Ken and I worked together for a couple years and it’s something that impacted me quite a lot, hence the reason I still refer to him as a mentor. </p><p>This episode is exploring background and also setting a tone for personal meaningful conversations. Speculation isn’t about me or Ken and we will do our best to make sure of that we make it engaging and about all of us so that it can be be a large and inclusive conversation, however, we have to start somewhere. </p><p>After you take a listen, we’d love for you to leave some comments or thoughts on this episode, maybe engaging in some of the thoughts or sharing parts of your own background story. </p>
